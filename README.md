# Blender-Shortcuts
Keyboard shortcut listing for common commands in my Blender tutorials.

**View:**  
* 1 - front view.  
* 3 - side view.  
* 5 - toggle between perspective and orthographic.  
*(Note: you must use the numpad keys for this, not the top row of number keys. If you do not have a numpad, enable 'emulate numpad' in the Input section of the user preferences. This will allow you to use the top row of numbers).*
  
**Edit:**  
* Tab - switch between object and edit mode.  
* A - select everything (unless something is already selected, in which case unselect everything).  
* B + left mouse drag - box selection (middle mouse drag allows deselecting).  
* E - extrude selection.  
* G - move tool.  
* H - hide selected (Alt + H to unhide).  
* R - rotation tool.  
* S - scale tool (Alt + S to shrink/fatten).  
* X - brings up delete menu.  
* Z - toggle wireframe/solid shading.  
  
* Pressing X or Y or Z while using tool such as grab/rotate/scale, will constrain the transform to that axis.  
* Ctrl + R - loopcut tool (cursor position determines location, orientation of cut. Use scrollwheel to increase/decrease number of cuts). 
* Shift + C - reset 3d cursor to centre of scene.  
* Shift + D - duplicate selection.  

* Hold down Ctrl - enables snapping.  
* Hold down Shift - allows for smaller adjustments while using tools like move/rotate/scale.  
  
**Menus:**  
* Spacebar - search bar (useful for finding tools if you forget the shortcut).  
* Shift + A - create mesh/object.
* W - 'specials' menu (subdivide, shading mode, smooth, etc).  
* Ctrl + E - edges menu (edge sliding, and others).  
* Alt + M - brings up merge options for selected vertices.  

* N - opens/closes properties panel.  
* T - opens/closes tool shelf.
